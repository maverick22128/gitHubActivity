  For decades, the offer has been sitting on the table. The next step in space exploration, NASA's most sought after plan to put a human on Mars. 
  Free training, a futuristic spaceship ride, food, and the experience of a lifetime is the mission that has been offered to anyone who really wants to accept it. Given these 
  specifications, the offer seems to good to be true, and well, it is. The problem is that the trip only comes with a one way ticket, accepting this mission is like making a 
  promise to kill yourself in three years. The trip takes two years, and then they supply you with enough food to keep doing research for another year until you are no longer 
  needed. Seems harsh, but c'mon, there has to be at least one person on this planet who is crazy enough to do it. A person who has nothing to live for, nothing to look forward 
  to, and nobody to care for. Well, it just so happens that I meet all of these criteria, and I, Jrue Jackson, am ready to die. 

  The first two years of travel seemed to fly by, and due to prior planning on the part of myself and NASA I never ran out of media to consume. SSDs filled with movies I had spent my whole life planning to see, books that I couldn't wait to discuss with other people...wait, what do I mean "other people"? I spoke to my last real person two years ago tomorrow, and our ship will land in 36 hours. I am suddenly unsure about this plan of mine, but I figure mars will probably be worth it. I spend the last day before landing puttering aroudn the ship, watching one more movie and sleeping for 12 hours. With nothing to do I have gotten very good at sleeping. Finally, after the ship runs it's auto-landing program, the console informs me it is safe to exit the craft. I put on my space suit and step outside.
