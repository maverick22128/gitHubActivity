  For decades, the offer has been sitting on the table. The next step in space exploration, NASA's most sought after plan to put a human on Mars. 
  Free training, a futuristic spaceship ride, food, and the experience of a lifetime is the mission that has been offered to anyone who really wants to accept it. Given these 
  specifications, the offer seems to good to be true, and well, it is. The problem is that the trip only comes with a one way ticket, accepting this mission is like making a 
  promise to kill yourself in three years. The trip takes two years, and then they supply you with enough food to keep doing research for another year until you are no longer 
  needed. Seems harsh, but c'mon, there has to be at least one person on this planet who is crazy enough to do it. A person who has nothing to live for, nothing to look forward 
  to, and nobody to care for. Well, it just so happens that I meet all of these criteria, and I, Jrue Jackson, am ready to die.
